The Open Source Geospatial Community
============================================

On this talk the presenter will explain what is the Open Source
Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), where does it comes from, and its main
activities. The OSGeo Foundation has been leading the development of
free software for geospatial for the last seven years, providing an
umbrella for many projects, big and small, from map servers to
web-mapping libraries or metadata catalogues. But beyond the software
development infrastructure, OSGeo is a big community of developers,
power users, documenters, translators, advocates, project and company
managers and enthusiasts of the geospatial open source software.
